# MOTOR-WINDING
how many motor we have?

We know there are generally three types of motors, AC motor, DC motor and special motor. AC motors are flexible for speed control and demand low power during start.
On the other hand,DC motors are widely used due to its initial cost of low power units is less compared to AC and can be easily installed.

#AC MOTOR
What is an AC Motor?

An AC motor is a motor that converts alternating current into mechanical power. The stator and the rotor are important parts of AC motors. The stator is the stationary part of the motor, and the rotor is the rotating part of the motor.
